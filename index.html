        <p>
          I am currently taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
          majoring in Multimedia Technology at University of Antique. I am very
          interested in technology and this means that I range really from
          anything Electronic, to all IT related things like programming (Python
          is my best ) network security or for example database management. My
          programming skills include Python, Java and C++, but I have a specific
          interest in web-design and multimedia. Throughout my academic career,
          I have the opportunity to working on many personal projects like
          building a web application for local business or designing secure
          network that serve small organization. I am always excited to learn
          new technologies and be in line with the future of IT. IT is the field
          that I am most excited about and hope to be working with exciting,
          innovative projects in it.

        <p>
          I passed my NC III in Visual Graphic Design through a combination of
          thorough preparation and continuous practice. I started by
          understanding the core competencies and completing all necessary
          modules. I honed my skills using software like Adobe Photoshop and
          Illustrator, creating a diverse portfolio. Seeking feedback from
          instructors and peers helped refine my work. Mock assessments
          familiarized me with the exam format, and staying updated with design
          trends ensured my work was relevant. My dedication and passion for
          graphic design were key to my success.

        <h3>My Experience as an IT Student</h3>
        <p>
          My journey as an IT student has been both challenging and rewarding,
          shaping me into a well-rounded and skilled individual ready to tackle
          the dynamic world of technology. From the outset, I was drawn to the
          endless possibilities that the field of Information Technology offers.
          My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in various
          programming languages, network security, and database management,
          allowing me to develop a comprehensive understanding of the IT
          landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my studies, I have had the opportunity to work on several
          real-world projects that have significantly enhanced my technical
          skills and problem-solving abilities. For instance, I developed a web
          application for a local business, which involved designing the user
          interface, coding the backend, and ensuring the overall functionality
          of the application. Additionally, I created a secure network for a
          small organization, which required me to apply my knowledge of network
          security protocols and best practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, my experience as an IT student has been transformative,
          equipping me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the
          field of technology. I am excited about the future and look forward to
          contributing to innovative projects and making a meaningful impact in
          the IT industry.
